Many women fail to get adequate vitamins and minerals on a daily basis. LUNA bar was created to help women get more of the nutrients often lacking in their meal plans while being 100% natural and as organic as possible. That's why LUNA bar contains ingredients, like folic acid (for healthy babies and mothers-to-be), soy protein (for a healthy heart), calcium (for strong bones), and 23 vitamins and minerals that are essential to a woman's everyday nutritional needs. As women ourselves, we understand the importance of maintaining overall health and wellness. How does LUNA compare with other bars? LUNA was the first bar specifically formulated with a woman's needs in mind. In just 180 calories, LUNA is entirely natural and 70% organic and meets many of the specific nutritional requirements women need to maintain active healthy lifestyles. LUNA bars also have no artificial sweeteners, no high fructose corn syrup and no trans fats. LUNA is dedicated to helping women meet the specific nutritional requirements to maintain active lifestyles. We take a whole-life approach, trying to embrace healthy living and bring communities of women together.
